</APPLET>
</p>
<p>
I created this applet around 1996.
It has two source files <a href="src/Delaunay.java">Delaunay.java</a>
which calculates the Delaunay triangulation in 2d, and
<a href="src/TriangulationViewer.java">Triangulation.java</a>
which contains the user interface elements.
Your browser may not support running Java applets or
it may have strict security controls that prevent the
applet from running.
You may need to confirm that it is OK to run this applet.
Also, browsers may not support the use of a status bar,
which this applet uses as a user interface element.
In any case, you can still run the applet by downloading
this repository and then execute:
</p>
<p>
appletviewer index.html
</p>
<p>
To use all the features of the applet, you will have to
adjust the Java security policy.
A sample policy file is included: <a href="src/applet.security.policy">applet.security.policy</a>.
To set a background color might be done with:
</p>
<p>
appletviewer -J-Djava.security.policy=applet.security.policy -J-Dblack=0x909090 index.html
</p>
At the time, I wrote this tutorial on triangulation.
I thought, and still think, it is interesting to use these applets to
generate static figures that highlight elements as the cursor hovers over it.

<p>
This tutorial examines <em>triangulation</em> in 2 dimensions.
Triangulation starts with a set of points in a plane.
By connecting the points to each other with line segments that
don't intersect, a triangulation is formed.  For example, Figure
1 is a triangulation of 4 points.
Each red point is connected to another red point.
We will discuss the yellow points later.
</p>
<p>
It might have occured to you that there are two different triangulations
for the 4 points in Figure 1.  The other triangulation would have connected
the top point to the point in the lower left hand corner.  However, the
depicted triangulation is, in a sense, better than the alternative.
For example, the line in the alternative solution is longer than the
line depicted in Figure 1.  This is an important point.  This means that
the bottom three points are closer together than the left three points.
This concept of closeness is intuitive to people, but more difficult to
describe in an algorithm.

Figure 2 contains 10 points.  Try to visualize
how these points should be connected so that all the
closest points form the triangles in the triangulation.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, even for a small set of points it can
be difficult to construct the best triangulation.  As
you move your cursor over the figure, the triangles
that form the best triangulation will be highlighted.
</p>
<p>
This particular notion of a best triangulation is known as
Delaunay Triangluation.  The Delaunay Triangulation has a
number of features that make it useful engineering and science.
For example, Delaunay Triangulation is used in astronomy for
identifying clusters of astronomical objects.

Related to triangulation is tessellation.  Figure 3
contains the tessellation of the same 10 points as
in Figure 2.
</p>
<p>
The tessellation divides the plane into polygon regions.
Each region contains a single data point.
All points within a region are closer to this data
point than any other data point.
As you move your cursor over the figure, the underlying
triangles of the triangulation will be highlighted.
You've probably also noticed that the yellow dots are located at
the corners of the regions outlined by the tessellation.
This is not a coincidence.  The tessellation and the triangulation
are tightly coupled mathematical notions.  Essentially they are
two means for specifying the same information.  Such closely related
notions are called "duals".
</p>
<p>
You may also have noticed a relationship between the line segments
that form the tessellation and the highlight triangles of the
triangulation.  Each line in the tesselation is perpendicular to
one of the lines in the triangle.  In fact, each line segment in
the tesselation is on the perpendicular bisector of a leg of one
of the triangles.
</p>
<p>
The Dirichlet tessellation is the dual of the Delaunay triangulation.
The vertices of the tesselation occur where three neighboring regions
meet.  This is the location of the yellow dots.

To review for a moment, the red dots are the data
points and are the vertices of the Delaunay triangles.
The yellow dots are the vertices of the Dirichlet
tessellation.
</p>
<p>
In general, each yellow dot is at the meeting point
of three neighboring regions.  <em>Therefore, each
yellow dot is the same distance away from the red
dots that are at the center of the three neighboring
regions.</em>  There is only one point that is the
same distance away from all three points.  If the
three red dots are on the perimeter of a circle, then
the yellow dot would be the circle's center.
Figure 4 is the same as Figure 3.  However, your cursor
will highlight the circumcircle of the underlying triangle.
It will also highlight the center of the circumcircle.
</p>
<p>
The <em>circumcircle</em> is the smallest circle that contains
the three points.  Since it is the smallest such circle, then the
three points must be on the edge of the circle.  Since the yellow
dot is equidistant from the three red dots, it must be at the center
of the circumcircle.
</p>
<p>
As you move your cursor over the Figure 4, you may have noticed that
there are no red dots on the inside of the circumcircle.  Again,
this is no coincidence.  Suppose that there were a red dot inside
of the circle.  This means that the yellow dot is closer to the
new red dot than any of the original 3 red dots.  And that doesn't
make any sense, because we know that the yellow dot is closer to
the original 3 red dots than any other red dots.  This is a
contradiction and therefore our supposition is incorrect.  That is,
there cannot be a red dot inside of the circumcircle.

Knowing that no other red dots can appear inside of the
circumcircle of a properly formed triangle in a Delaunay
triangulation is very useful.  But, like with most things,
there are exceptions.  For example look at Figure 5.  These
four points form a square.  The opposite diagonal of the square
could have been used to form the triangluation of these 4
points. All four points are equidistant from the yellow dot
at the center of the square.
</p>
<p>
Fortuately, these types of <em>degenerate</em> cases are unlikely
to occur and in practice have little or no consequence.
</p>
<p>
Can you think of any other degenerate cases?

Another interesting aspect of Delaunay triangle has to do
with the size of the angles in the triangles.  For example,
Figure 6 is the triangulation of a parallelogram.
Consider the angles in the 2 triangles that make up the triangulation.
By construction the 2 triangles are similar.
All 3 angles in the triangle are roughly the same
and it is difficult to see which angle is the smallest.
Now consider the alternative triangulation using the opposite diagonal:
this would have a smaller angle near the top and bottom of the figure,
and a larger angle on the left and right of the figure.
The Delaunary triangulation maximizes the minimum of the angles in the
triangles.
This is the attribute that makes this triangulation a good measure of closeness.
