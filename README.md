# Delaunay Triangulation

I wrote this applet in the 1990s.
Support for Java applets in browsers is deprecated.
In 2017 these can be run using the `appletviewer`.
To run these applets you must download this repository.
It includes `applet.security.policy` to open up security if necessary.

To run this applet:
```
appletviewer index.html
```
